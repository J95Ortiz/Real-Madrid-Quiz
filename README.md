## OVERVIEW

## WIREFRAMES

The wireframes were created on Balsmiq and were used to represent the structure and layout intended on the site

Although the final design varies slightly from the initial wireframes, these can be seen below:

## PERFORMANCE & ACCESSIBILITY

The questions used in the quiz, and the file with the quiz setup and structure are stored in separate JS files:

1. [Quiz Questions and Answers File](assets/js/questions.js)

2. [Quiz Creator and Logic File](assets/js/script.js)

This way in future whenever anyone wants to add a question, update the answers or remove a question this is now easier to do.

## VALIDATOR TESTING

The W3C [Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) was used to check the HTML code on both pages, and they passed.
